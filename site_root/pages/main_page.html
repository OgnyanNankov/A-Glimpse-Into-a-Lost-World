        <h1>A Glimpse Into a Lost World</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>Cenozoic (66 million years ago until today) means ‘recent life.’ During this era, plants and animals looked
            most like those on Earth today. The Cenozoic is also known as the Age of Mammals because the terrestrial
            animals that dominated both hemispheres were mammals – the eutherians (placentals) in the northern
            hemisphere and the metatherians (marsupials, now mainly restricted to Australia and to some extent South
            America) in the southern hemisphere </h2>

            <p> During that time, we can find the last known hunter-gatherer society to live in Europe, the Mesolithic
                people. They lived in Europe
                from around 10,000 to 5,000 years ago, before the arrival of farming communities. They were known for
                their hunting and gathering lifestyles, as well as for their use of stone tools.
                Ice sheets expanded across much of northern Europe from around 25,000 to 19,000 years ago, making a huge
                expanse of land unlivable. That harsh event set in motion a previously unrecognized tale of two human
                populations that played out at opposite ends of the continent.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            Western European hunter-gatherers outlasted the icy blast in the past. Easterners got replaced by
            migrations of newcomers.
            As researchers have long thought, southwestern Europe provided refuge from the last Ice Age’s big chill
            for hunter-gatherers based in and near that region, the scientists say. But it turns out that
            southeastern Europe, where Italy is now located, did not offer lasting respite from the cold for nearby
            groups, as previously assumed.

            Instead, those people were replaced by genetically distinct hunter-gatherers who presumably had lived
            just to the east along the Balkan Peninsula.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Those people, who carried ancestry from parts of
                southwestern Asia, began trekking into what’s now northern Italy by about 17,000 years ago, as the Ice
                Age began to wane.

                “If local [Ice Age] populations in Italy did not survive and were replaced by groups from the Balkans,
                this completely changes our interpretation of the archaeological record,” says Posth, of the University
                of Tübingen in Germany.

                Posth and colleagues’ conclusions rest on analyses of DNA from 356 ancient hunter-gatherers, including
                new molecular evidence for 116 individuals from 14 countries in Europe and Asia. Excavated human remains
                that yielded DNA dated to between about 45,000 and 5,000 years ago.

                Comparisons of sets of gene variants inherited by these hunter-gatherers from common ancestors enabled
                the researchers to reconstruct population movements and replacements that shaped ancient Europeans’
                genetic makeup. For the first time, ancient DNA evidence included individuals from what’s known as the
                Gravettian culture, which dates from about 33,000 to 26,000 years ago in central and southern Europe,
                and from southwestern Europe’s Solutrean culture, which dates to between about 24,000 and 19,000 years
                ago.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Contrary to expectations, makers of Gravettian tools came from two genetically distinct groups that
                populated western and eastern Europe for roughly 10,000 years before the Ice Age reached its peak, Posth
                says. Researchers have traditionally regarded Gravettian implements as products of a biologically
                uniform population that occupied much of Europe.

                “What we previously thought was one genetic ancestry in Europe turned out to be two,” says
                paleogeneticist Mateja Hajdinjak of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig,
                Germany, who did not participate in the new study. And “it seems that western and southwestern Europe
                served as a [refuge from glaciation] more than southeastern Europe and Italy.”

                Descendants of the western Gravettian population, who are associated with Solutrean artifacts and
                remnants of another ancient culture in western Europe that ran from about 19,000 to 14,000 years ago,
                outlasted the Ice Age before spreading northeastward across Europe, the researchers say.Ultimately,
                descendants of Ice Age migrants into Italy reached southern Italy and then western Europe by around
                14,000 years ago, Posth and colleagues say. Ancient DNA evidence indicates that, during those travels,
                they left a major genetic mark on hunter-gatherers across Europe.
