        <h2>Human evolution is the lengthy process of change by which people originated from apelike ancestors.
            Scientific evidence shows that the physical and behavioral traits shared by all people originated from
            apelike ancestors and evolved over a period of approximately six million years. It is the
            evolutionary process within the history of primates that led to the emergence of Homo sapiens as a distinct
            species of the hominid family, which includes all the great apes.

            <h2>Early modern human</h2>
            <br>
            Early modern human, or anatomically modern human, are terms used to distinguish Homo sapiens
            (the only extant Hominina species) that are anatomically consistent with the range of phenotypes seen in
            contemporary humans, from extinct archaic human species. This distinction is useful especially for times and
            regions where anatomically modern and archaic humans co-existed, for example, in Paleolithic Europe.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Among the oldest known remains of Homo sapiens are those found at the Omo-Kibish I archaeological site in
                south-western Ethiopia, dating to about 233,000 to 196,000 years ago, the Florisbad site in South
                Africa, dating to about 259,000 years ago, and the Jebel Irhoud site in Morocco, dated about 315,000
                years ago.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The term Middle Paleolithic is intended to cover the time between the first emergence of H. sapiens
                (roughly 300,000 years ago) and the period held by some to mark the emergence of full behavioral
                modernity (roughly by 50,000 years ago, corresponding to the start of the Upper Paleolithic).
                Many of the early modern human finds, like those of Jebel Irhoud, Omo, Herto, Florisbad, Skhul, and
                Peștera cu Oase exhibit a mix of archaic and modern traits. Skhul V, for example, has
                prominent brow ridges and a projecting face. However, the brain case is quite rounded and distinct from
                that of the Neanderthals and is similar to the brain case of modern humans. It is uncertain whether the
                robust traits of some of the early modern humans like Skhul V reflects mixed ancestry or retention of
                older traits.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The "gracile" or lightly built skeleton of anatomically modern humans has been connected to a change in
                behavior, including increased cooperation and "resource transport".
                There is evidence that the characteristic human brain development, especially the prefrontal cortex, was
                due to "an exceptional acceleration of metabolome evolution ... paralleled by a drastic reduction in
                muscle strength. The observed rapid metabolic changes in brain and muscle, together with the unique
                human cognitive skills and low muscle performance, might reflect parallel mechanisms in human
                evolution." The Schöningen spears and their correlation of finds are evidence that complex
                technological skills already existed 300,000 years ago, and are the first obvious proof of an active
                (big game) hunt. H. heidelbergensis already had intellectual and cognitive skills like anticipatory
                planning, thinking and acting that so far have only been attributed to modern man.

            <p>
                The ongoing admixture events within anatomically modern human populations make it difficult to estimate
                the age of the matrilinear and patrilinear most recent common ancestors of modern populations
                (Mitochondrial Eve and Y-chromosomal Adam). Estimates of the age of Y-chromosomal Adam have been pushed
                back significantly with the discovery of an ancient Y-chromosomal lineage in 2013, to likely beyond
                300,000 years ago.There have, however, been no reports of the survival of Y-chromosomal or
                mitochondrial DNA clearly deriving from archaic humans (which would push back the age of the most recent
                patrilinear or matrilinear ancestor beyond 500,000 years).
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Dispersal of early H. sapiens begins soon after its emergence, as evidenced by the North African Jebel
                Irhoud finds (dated to around 315,000 years ago). There is indirect evidence for H. sapiens
                presence in West Asia around 270,000 years ago.
                The Florisbad Skull from Florisbad, South Africa, dated to about 259,000 years ago, has also been
                classified as representing early H. sapiens. In September 2019, scientists proposed that the earliest H.
                sapiens (and last common human ancestor to
                modern humans) arose between 350,000 and 260,000 years ago through a merging of populations in East and
                South Africa.Among extant populations, the Khoi-San (or "Capoid") hunters-gatherers of Southern Africa
                may represent the human population with the earliest possible divergence within the group Homo sapiens
                sapiens. Their separation time has been estimated in a 2017 study to be between 350 and 260,000 years
                ago, compatible with the estimated age of early H. sapiens.

            <br>
            <p>
                Physiological or phenotypical changes have been traced to Upper Paleolithic mutations, such as the East
                Asian variant of the EDAR gene, dated to c. 35,000 years ago.
                Recent divergence of Eurasian lineages was sped up significantly during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM),
                the Mesolithic and the Neolithic, due to increased selection pressures and due to founder effects
                associated with migration.[116] Alleles predictive of light skin have been found in Neanderthals,
                but the alleles for light skin in Europeans and East Asians, associated with KITLG and ASIP, are (as of
                2012) thought to have not been acquired by archaic admixture but recent mutations since the LGM.
                Examples for still later adaptations related to agriculture and animal domestication including East
                Asian types of ADH1B associated with rice domestication, or lactase persistence, are due
                to recent selection pressures.
                An even more recent adaptation has been proposed for the Austronesian Sama-Bajau, developed under
                selection pressures associated with subsisting on freediving over the past thousand years or so.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Homo sapiens technological and cultural progress appears to have been very much faster in recent
                millennia than in Homo sapiens early periods. The pace of development may indeed have accelerated, due
                to massively larger population (so more humans extant to think of innovations), more communication and
                sharing of ideas among human populations, and the accumulation of thinking tools. However it may also be
                that the pace of advancements always looks relatively faster to humans in the time they live, because
                previous advances are unrecognised. <a class="news"

                evolution." The Schöningen spears and their correlation of finds are evidence that complex
                technological skills already existed 300,000 years ago, and are the first obvious proof of an active
                (big game) hunt. H. heidelbergensis already had intellectual and cognitive skills like anticipatory
                planning, thinking and acting that so far have only been attributed to modern man.

                The ongoing admixture events within anatomically modern human populations make it difficult to estimate
                the age of the matrilinear and patrilinear most recent common ancestors of modern populations
                (Mitochondrial Eve and Y-chromosomal Adam). Estimates of the age of Y-chromosomal Adam have been pushed
                back significantly with the discovery of an ancient Y-chromosomal lineage in 2013, to likely beyond
                300,000 years ago.There have, however, been no reports of the survival of Y-chromosomal or
                mitochondrial DNA clearly deriving from archaic humans (which would push back the age of the most recent
                patrilinear or matrilinear ancestor beyond 500,000 years).

                Dispersal of early H. sapiens begins soon after its emergence, as evidenced by the North African Jebel
                Irhoud finds (dated to around 315,000 years ago). There is indirect evidence for H. sapiens
                presence in West Asia around 270,000 years ago.
                The Florisbad Skull from Florisbad, South Africa, dated to about 259,000 years ago, has also been
                classified as representing early H. sapiens. In September 2019, scientists proposed that the earliest H.
                sapiens (and last common human ancestor to
                modern humans) arose between 350,000 and 260,000 years ago through a merging of populations in East and
                South Africa.Among extant populations, the Khoi-San (or "Capoid") hunters-gatherers of Southern Africa
                may represent the human population with the earliest possible divergence within the group Homo sapiens
                sapiens. Their separation time has been estimated in a 2017 study to be between 350 and 260,000 years
                ago, compatible with the estimated age of early H. sapiens.

                Physiological or phenotypical changes have been traced to Upper Paleolithic mutations, such as the East
                Asian variant of the EDAR gene, dated to c. 35,000 years ago.
                Recent divergence of Eurasian lineages was sped up significantly during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM),
                the Mesolithic and the Neolithic, due to increased selection pressures and due to founder effects
                associated with migration.[116] Alleles predictive of light skin have been found in Neanderthals,
                but the alleles for light skin in Europeans and East Asians, associated with KITLG and ASIP, are (as of
                2012) thought to have not been acquired by archaic admixture but recent mutations since the LGM.
                Examples for still later adaptations related to agriculture and animal domestication including East
                Asian types of ADH1B associated with rice domestication, or lactase persistence, are due
                to recent selection pressures.
                An even more recent adaptation has been proposed for the Austronesian Sama-Bajau, developed under
                selection pressures associated with subsisting on freediving over the past thousand years or so.

                Homo sapiens technological and cultural progress appears to have been very much faster in recent
                millennia than in Homo sapiens early periods. The pace of development may indeed have accelerated, due
                to massively larger population (so more humans extant to think of innovations), more communication and
                sharing of ideas among human populations, and the accumulation of thinking tools. However it may also be
                that the pace of advancements always looks relatively faster to humans in the time they live, because
                previous advances are unrecognised. <a class="news"
