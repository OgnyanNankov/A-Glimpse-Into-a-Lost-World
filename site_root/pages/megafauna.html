    <h2>The most common usage encountered in academic and popular writing describes land mammals roughly larger than a
      human that are not (solely) domesticated. The term is especially associated with the Pleistocene megafauna – the
      land animals that are considered archetypical of the last ice age, such as mammoths, the majority of which in
      northern Eurasia, Australia-New Guinea and the Americas became extinct within the last forty thousand years. </h2>

        Woolly mammoth - one of the most recognizable extinct mammals and most characteristic of large animals of the
        Quaternary period. Thanks to the well-preserved paleontological materials in the form of bone remaining in the
        permafrost mummies and paleo-art facilities, we can reconstruct its shape with high reliability.
      </p>
      <br>
      In comparison to modern elephants, the woolly mammoth looked like little more than short-legged. Its whole body is
      covered with a thick coat with a dense undercoat: the length of hair on the shoulders, flanks and hips reached 70
      cm, forming a kind of fringe observed in modern yak. The tail also had a brush of stiff and thick hair. Coat color
      changed from black-n-brown to reddish; cubs were painted lighter.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The head was massive, with relatively shorter trunk and furry little ears; located on the back of a fatty hump
        (additional adaptation to the cold climate). It is noteworthy that the huge tusks had a peculiar spiral curved.
        Tusks of the large males can reach 4 m. The evidence of intensive use its tusks are traces of abrasion even in
        teenage individuals. Lifestyle and social structure of mammoths were apparently similar to what can be observed
        in the surviving elephants today. The point about the dominance in their groups of the old matriarch female
        pilot confirms discovery of dead mammoths whole family from the Bryansk region, which consisted of adult
        females, subadult males and cubs. The habitat of the mammoth - is open grassy plains, as the characteristic
        landscape of the late Pleistocene considered tundra, combines the features of a modern tundra and forest-steppe.

        In connection with a characteristic sequence of animals, this giant ecosystem stretching from Britain to Alaska,
        also called the "mammoth steppe" . Its vast areas were heterogeneous in productivity, and the most fodder places
        are river valleys. Most likely that in the warm season the animals feed mainly sedges and grasses, while in
        winter the diet includes shoots of trees and shrubs; in cold areas were primarily polar birch and willow. Woolly
        Mammoth is a contemporary of the Human from the Stone Age, inspired the ancient artists to create gorgeous cave
        art and artfully made figurines. Sometimes its bones were used as building material - known archaeological
        remains of ancient huts fortified ivory. Manufactured from bones also spearheads and arrowheads, needles and
        jewelry.According to the scientists, explore the ancient climate, abrupt climate changes have led to the
        disappearance of the typical representatives of the mammoth fauna in the vast territory. <a class="news"

        The woolly rhinoceros was well adapted for life in of the harsh conditions of the ice age. Numerous findings of
        separate bones, skeletons, mummified remnants with muscle, skin and fur preserved in permafrost, allow us to
        recreate the way they looked quite precisely.
      </p>
      <br>
      It was a powerful animal with short legs, a tall nape and large head, with two horns. The front horn grew to 100
      cm and took the shape of a saber. The body of the rhino was covered with thick chestnut fur, and its
      half-a-meter-long tail had a switch of coarse hair. With the help of its huge horns, the rhinoceroses repulsed the
      attacks of predators or opponents. However, the horns show signs of wear, suggesting that they were used to obtain
      food from under the snow.An adult woolly rhinoceros typically measured 3.2 to 3.6 metres from
      head to tail, stood 1.45–1.6 metres tall at the shoulder, and weighed up to 1.5–2 metric tons.
      Both males and females had two horns which were made of keratin, with one long horn
      reaching forward and a smaller horn between the eyes.The front horn would have measured 1–1.35 metres
      long for individuals at 25 to 35 years of age, while the second horn would have measured up to 47.5
      centimetres long.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        About 90% of all findings of this animal are concentrated in northern Eurasia, and maximum range of the species
        took place during the second half of the Pleistocene. Nevertheless, the woolly rhinoceroses lived even in Italy,
        grazing on the hayfields on the shores of rivers, side by side with hippos, eating steppe herbs, bush shoots and
        other vegetation.This species, which seemed to be calm, had a bad temper and could unexpectedly attack anybody
        who happened to be
        nearby. Our ancestors came into contact with woolly rhinoceroses, with cave drawings made by primitive humans
        providing confirmation.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The woolly rhinoceros had a similar life history to modern rhinos. Studies on milk teeth show that individuals
        developed similarly to both the white and black rhinoceros. With their massive horns and size, adults had few
        predators, but young individuals could be attacked by animals such as hyenas and cave lions. A skull was found
        with trauma indicating an attack from a feline, but the animal survived to adulthood. Many cave paintings from
        the Upper Paleolithic depict woolly rhinoceroses. The site of Dolní Věstonice in Czech Republic, was
        found with more than seven hundred statuettes of animals, many of woolly rhinoceroses, showing the significant
        place this animal had in the culture of the archaic humans. <a class="news"

        Elasmotherium (meaning, "Thin Plate Beast"), more informally sometimes called the Steppe Rhinoceros, is an
        extinct genus of giant rhinoceros endemic to Eurasia during the Late Pliocene through the Pleistocene,
        documented from 2.6 million years ago, to as late as 50,000 years ago, possibly later, in the Late Pleistocene,
        an approximate span of slightly less than 2.6 million years. Three species are recognised.
      </p>
      <br>
      It was the size of a mammoth and is thought to have borne a large, thick horn on its
      forehead which was used for defence, attracting mates, driving away competitors, sweeping snow from the grass in
      winter and digging for water and plant roots. Like all rhinoceroses, elasmotheres were herbivorous. Unlike any
      others, its high-crowned molars were ever-growing. Its legs were longer than those of other rhinos and were
      designed for galloping, giving it a horse-like gait. The paleontologists of the 19th century who
      discovered and named the initial fossils were influenced by ancient legends of a huge unicorn roaming the steppes
      of Siberia. To date no evidence either contradicts or confirms the possibility that Elasmotherium survived into
      legendary times.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>The Elasmotherium was the largest member of the family of rhinos that lived from the Pliocene to Pleistocene
        epochs. It was 6 metres long, 2.5 metres in height and weigh up to 5 tons. The main difference from other rhino
        was the large domed protuberance on the forehead, which was probably a 1.5 metre long and thick horn.
        Elasmotherium were distributed from western Europe to eastern Siberia.F
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        For all its size, bulk and presumed aggressiveness, though, Elasmotherium was most likely a relatively gentle
        herbivore—and one well-adapted to eating grass rather than leaves or shrubs, as evidenced by its almost
        comically heavy, oversized, flat teeth and lack of incisors. It was more than capable of defending itself,
        though. If it was like its Rhino descendants, their poor sense of sight would pose a high tendency to attack
        those near. The largest of all the prehistoric rhinoceroses of the Pleistocene epoch, Elasmotherium was a truly
        massive piece of megafauna, and all the more imposing thanks to its thick, shaggy coat of fur and the huge horn
        on the end of its snout. Due to its signature single horn not found in many ungulates, Elasmotherium was given
        the nickname "Siberian Unicorn" by the public. If Elasmotherium survived into historical times, it's possible
        that early humans glimpsing this huge, strange beast may have been inspired to create the legend of the unicorn.

      <p> The steppe bison or steppe wisent is an extinct bison found on steppes throughout Europe, Central Asia,
        Beringia, and North America during the Quaternary. It is believed that it evolved somewhere in South Asia which
        would have it appearing at roughly the same time and region as the aurochs with which its descendants are
        sometimes confused.

      late Pleistocene, as it was replaced in Europe by the modern wisent species and in America by a sequence of
      species (first Bison latifrons, and somewhat later, Bison antiquus) culminating in the modern American bison.
      The steppe wisent was over two metres tall and resembled the modern bison species, reaching 900 kg in weight. The
      tips of the horns were a meter apart, the horns themselves being over half a meter long. Bison priscus gigas is
      the largest known bison species of Eurasia; the species was possibly analogous to Bison latifrons, attaining
      similar body sizes and horns which were up to 210 centimeters apart, and presumably favored similar habitat
      conditions. Steppe wisent occasionally appear in cave art, notably in the Cave of Altamira and Lascaux, and have
      been found in naturally ice-preserved form.

        Steppe bison appear in cave art, notably in the Cave of Altamira and Lascaux, and the carving Bison Licking
        Insect Bite, and have been found in naturally ice-preserved form.Blue Babe is the 36,000-year-old mummy of a
        male steppe bison which was discovered north of Fairbanks, Alaska, in July 1979.The mummy was noticed by a gold
        miner who named the mummy Blue Babe – "Babe" for Paul Bunyan's mythical giant ox, permanently turned blue when
        he was buried to the horns in a blizzard (Blue Babe's own bluish
        cast was caused by a coating of vivianite, a blue iron phosphate covering much of the specimen). Blue Babe is
        also frequently referenced when talking about scientists eating their own specimens: the research team that was
        preparing it for permanent display in the University of Alaska Museum removed a portion of the mummy's neck,
        stewed it, and dined on it to celebrate the accomplishment. In 2011, a 9,300-year-old mummy was found at Yukagir
        in Siberia

      <br>
      <p>The causes for the extinction of the steppe bison and many other primarily megafaunal species remain hotly
        debated, but the selectivity for large animals suggests that the spread of modern humans played a substantial
        role.
        In 2016, a frozen tail was discovered in the north of the Republic of Sakha in Russia. The exact age was not
        clear, but tests showed it was not younger than 8,000 years old. A team of Russian and South Korean
        scientists proposed extracting DNA from the specimen and cloning it in the future.

        The last European wild horse died out as late as in 1909. Before that, wild horses roamed through most of
        Europe’s ecosystems, from deserts, steppes and savannahs to deep forests and high mountains.
      </p>
      <br>
      Wild horses have been present in Europe since the Pleistocene and ranged from southern France and Spain east to
      central Russia. There are cave drawings of primitive predomestication horses at Lascaux, France and in Cave of
      Altamira, Spain, as well as artifacts believed to show the species in southern Russia, where a horse of this type
      was domesticated around 3000 BC. Equus ferus had a continuous range from western Europe to Alaska; historic
      material suggests wild horses lived in most parts of Holocene continental Europe and the Eurasian steppe, except
      for parts of Scandinavia, Iceland and Ireland.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The appearance of European wild horses may be reconstructed with genetic, osteologic and historic data. One
        genetic study suggests that bay was the predominant color in European wild horses.During the Mesolithic, a
        gene coding a black coat color appeared on the Iberian peninsula. This color spread east but was less common
        than bay in the investigated sample and never reached Siberia. Bay in combination with dun results in the
        "bay dun" color seen in Przewalski's horses; black with dun creates the grullo coat. A loss of the dun dilution
        may have been advantageous in more forested western European landscapes, as dark colors were a better camouflage
        in forests. Pangaré or "mealy" coloration, a characteristic of other wild equines, might have been present
        in at least some European wild horses, as historic accounts report a light belly.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The human-caused extinction of wild horses in Europe began in Southern Europe, possibly in antiquity. While
        humans had been hunting wild horses since the Paleolithic, during historic times horse meat was an important
        source of protein for many cultures. As large herbivores, the range of the tarpan was continuously decreased by
        the increasing human population of the Eurasian landmass. Wild horses were further targeted because they caused
        damage to hay stores and often took domestic mares from pastures. Furthermore, interbreeding with wild horses
        was an economic loss for farmers since the foals of such matings were intractable. In recent yearsm attempts
        have been made
        to use selective breeding to create a type of horse that resembles the European wild horse phenotype. A herd
        that is part of the breeding-back project can be seen in the East Rhodope Mountains, near the town of
        Madzharovo. <a class="news" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarpan" target="_blank">Read More</a>

        Panthera spelaea, also known as the cave lion or steppe lion, is an extinct Panthera species that most likely
        evolved in Europe after the third Cromerian interglacial stage, less than 600,000 years ago. Genetic analysis of
        ancient DNA has revealed that while closely related, it was distinct species genetically isolated from the
        modern lion (Panthera leo) occurring in Africa and Asia, with the genetic divergence between the two species
        variously estimated between 1.9 million and 600,000 years ago. It is closely related and probably
        ancestral to the American lion (Panthera atrox). The species ranged from Western Europe to eastern Beringia
        in North America, and was a prominent member of the mammoth steppe fauna. It became extinct about 13,000 years
        ago.
      </p>
      <br>
      P. spelaea bone fragments excavated in Poland were radiocarbon dated to between the early and late Weichselian
      glaciation, and are between 109,000 and 57,000 years old. In Eurasia, it became extinct between 14,900 and
      14,100 years ago, and survived in Beringia until 13,800 to 13,300 years ago as the Weichselian glaciation
      receded. Mitochondrial DNA sequence data from fossil lion remains show that the American lion represents a
      sister group of P. spelaea, and likely arose when an early P. spelaea population became isolated south of the
      Cordilleran Ice Sheet about 340,000 years ago. The following cladogram shows the genetic relationship between
      P. spelaea and other pantherine cats.

      <br>
      <p>
        Carvings and cave paintings of cave lions, which were discovered in the Lascaux and Chauvet Caves in France,
        were dated to 15,000 to 17,000 years old. A drawing in the Chauvet cave depicts two cave lions walking
        together. The one in the foreground is slightly smaller than the one in the background, which has been drawn
        with a scrotum and without a mane. Such cave paintings suggest that male cave lions completely lacked manes,
        or at most had very small manes.P. spelaea is also known from the Löwenmensch figurine found in Vogelherd cave
        in the Swabian Alb, southwest Germany, which dates to the Aurignacian culture. These archaeological artifacts
        indicate that it may have been featured in Paleolithic religious rituals.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        P. spelaea formed a contiguous population from western Europe to the Yukon over the Bering land bridge, across
        the range of the mammoth steppe. It was widely distributed from the Iberian Peninsula, Southeast Europe,
        Great Britain, Central Europe, the East European Plain, and across most of northern Eurasia into Alaska and
        Canada. The oldest known fossils were excavated in northeastern Yakutia and were radiocarbon dated at 62,400
        years old. The youngest known fossils are dated 11,925 years old and originated near Fairbanks, Alaska.

        The name Homotherium was proposed by Emilio Fabrini(1890), without further explanation, for a new subgenus of
        Machairodus,
        whose main distinguishing feature was the presence of a large diastema between the two inferior premolars. He
        further described two species in this new subgenus: Machairodus (Megantereon) crenatidens and Machairodus
        (Megantereon) nestianus.The first fossils of this genus were described in 1846 by Richard Owen as the species
        Machairodus latidens.
      </p>
      <br>
      In 1918, the species Homotherium moravicum was described by Woldřich. In 1936, Teilhard de Chardin described
      the new species Homotherium ultimus based on fossils from the middle Pleistocene-aged site at Zhoukoudian. In
      1972, a species Homotherium davitašvlii was described based on fragmentary material found at Kvabebi in
      Georgia. Further material from Odessa was tentatively assigned to this species in 2004. In 1986, the species
      Homotherium darvasicum was described based on material from Kuruksay, Turkey. In 1989, another species
      Homotherium tielhardipiveteaui was named based on fossils from Tajikistan. In 1996, Homotherium
      hengduanshanense was described based on fossils from the Hengduan Mountains
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The lineage of Homotherium is estimated (based on mitochondrial DNA sequences) to have diverged from that of
        Smilodon about 18 million years ago. Homotherium has been suggested to have originated from African species
        of the genus Amphimachairodus.[30] Homotherium first appeared during the Early Pliocene, about 4 million years
        ago, with its oldest remains being from the Odesa catacombs in Ukraine, and Koobi Fora in Kenya, which are close
        in age, making the origin location of the genus uncertain. The genus arrived in North America during the late
        Pliocene. Specimens of Homotherium are known from Venezuela in northern South America, of an uncertain
        Early-Middle Pleistocene age.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        On the African continent the genus disappeared about 1.5 million years ago,
        during the Early Pleistocene. Homotherium was formerly thought to have become extinct in Eurasia during the
        late Middle Pleistocene, around 300,000 years ago, until the discovery of a single jaw bone from the North Sea
        which dates to around 28-30,000 years ago. Homotherium became extinct around 12,000 years ago
        as part of the Quaternary extinction event along with most other large mammals.
        Early humans (Homo sapiens), and even our close relatives like Neanderthals & Homo erectus, encountered this
        powerful animal and highly admired it. <a class="news" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotherium"

        Along with mammoths, lions and woolly rhinos, cave bears (Ursus spelaeus) were once among Europe's most
        impressive creatures. Males weighed up to 1,500 pounds, 50 percent more than the largest modern grizzlies. Cave
        bears had wider heads than today's bears, and powerful shoulders and forelimbs.
      </p>
      <br>
      Prehistoric humans painted images of the animals on cave walls and carved their likeness in fragments of mammoth
      tusk. But the relationship between humans and cave bears has been mysterious. Were humans prey for the bears, or
      predators? Were bears objects of worship or fear?

        Cave bears evolved in Europe more than 100,000 years ago. Initially they shared the continent with Neanderthals.
        For a time, archaeologists thought Neanderthals worshiped the bears, or even shared caves with them. The idea
        was popularized by Jean Auel's 1980 novel, The Clan of the Cave Bear, but has since been rejected by
        researchers.
        Modern humans arrived in Europe about 40,000 years ago and were soon aware of the bears. The walls of France's
        Chauvet cave, occupied 32,000 years ago, are painted with lions, hyenas and bears—perhaps the oldest paintings
        in the world.

        Cave bears disappeared not long after humans spread throughout Europe. Could hunting have led to the bears'
        extinction? That's not likely, according to Washington University at St. Louis anthropologist Erik Trinkaus.
        "People living in the late Pleistocene weren't stupid," he says. "They spent an awful lot of time avoiding being
        eaten, and one of the ways to do that is to stay away from big bears." If hunting was an isolated event, as he
        argues, there must be another reason the bears died out.After studying hundreds of bones from dozens of sites in
        Europe, Bocherens has found that cave bears mainly ate plants. That would have made the bears particularly
        vulnerable to the last ice age, which began around 30,000 years ago.

        The prolonged cold period shortened or eliminated growing seasons and changed the distributions of plant species
        across Europe. Cave bears began to move from their old territories, according to a DNA analysis led by
        researchers at the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig of teeth found near the Danube River. A new study does
        support
        a different explanation for the cave bear's demise. As cavemen—Neanderthals and then a growing population of
        modern humans—moved into the caves of Europe, cave bears had fewer safe places to hibernate. An acute housing
        shortage may have been the final blow for these magnificent beasts.
